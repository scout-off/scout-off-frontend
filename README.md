## Implementation notes

These documents contain implementation detail that is still actively relevant but lives at the repo root rather than under `docs/`. If you are working in the areas they cover, read them first.

## What is ScoutOff

ScoutOff is a decentralized football scouting platform that empowers talented players in underserved regions. It combines on-chain player profiles, validator-approved milestones, and pay-to-contact gating to create a trusted discovery marketplace.

## Why it matters

- **Unearth hidden talent** from regions that lack established scouting networks.
- **Protect scouts** with tamper-resistant progress history and verified achievements.
- **Enable fair access** through low-cost XLM payments and subscription controls.
- **Improve confidence** for scouts, coaches, and players with transparent on-chain records.

## Highlights

- **Player profiles on-chain** with IPFS-backed highlights and verified metadata.
- **Validator-approved progress** from coaches, academies, and certified trainers.
- **Scout discovery** by region, position, and progress level.
- **Pay-to-contact gating** for controlled introductions.
- **Admin tooling** for validators, fees, and emergency pause.
- **Multilingual UI** in English, French, and Swahili.

## Features

- **Dynamic player identity**: on-chain vitals, location, position, verified stats, and IPFS media.
- **Verified milestone workflow**: approved validators write performance milestones to Soroban.
- **Tamper-proof audit trail**: every progress update is recorded immutably.
- **Scout search & filters**: find players by region, role, and verification tier.
- **Pay-to-contact**: XLM micro-fees unlock direct player contact information.
- **Scout subscriptions**: recurring access controls reduce spam and gate discovery.
- **SEP-10 wallet auth**: secure login using Freighter, Albedo, or Lobstr.
- **Sponsorship vision**: future fractionalized player token funding for travel and training.

## Smart contract functions

### Player

- `register_player(wallet, vitals, ipfs_hash)` — create a player profile with on-chain metadata and IPFS media.
- `update_profile(player_id, ipfs_hash)` — refresh profile media (player authorization required).

### Validator

- `approve_milestone(player_id, milestone, validator)` — record a verified milestone and advance progress.
- `revoke_milestone(player_id, milestone_id)` — revoke a milestone (admin or validator authorization required).

### Scout

- `subscribe(scout, tier)` — purchase a scout subscription tier in XLM.
- `pay_to_contact(scout, player_id)` — unlock player contact details after a micro-fee.
- `log_trial_offer(scout, player_id, details)` — record a trial offer and advance the player to Elite Tier.

### Admin

- `initialize(admin, platform_token, fee_config)` — one-time contract bootstrap.
- `add_validator(validator_address)` — authorize a validator.
- `remove_validator(validator_address)` — revoke a validator.
- `withdraw_fees(to)` — withdraw accumulated platform fees.
- `pause_contract()` / `unpause_contract()` — emergency pause controls.

### Queries

- `get_player(player_id)` — full player profile, milestone history, and progress level.
- `get_milestone_history(player_id)` — ordered on-chain milestone history.
- `get_validators()` — active validator list.
- `get_subscription(scout)` — current scout tier and expiry.

## Progress levels

| Level | Name              | Entry condition                         |
| ----: | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
|     0 | Unverified        | Profile created with initial data       |
|     1 | Verified Identity | KYC or academy confirms club membership |
|     2 | Performance       | Validator-approved milestone logged     |
|     3 | Elite Tier        | Scout logs a trial offer                |

### Transitions

| From    | To      | Trigger                                                    |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 0 | Level 1 | Academy or KYC confirms active club membership             |
| Level 1 | Level 2 | Approved validator writes a verified performance milestone |
| Level 2 | Level 3 | Scout logs `log_trial_offer` and advances the player       |

## Security

- **Validator authorization** restricts milestone writes to approved validators.
- **Immutable audit trail** stores progress history and timestamps on-chain.
- **Strict authorization checks** secure every state-changing action.
- **Safe arithmetic** protects fee and subscription logic.
- **Anti-spam gating** uses subscriptions and pay-to-contact fees.
- **Circuit breaker** allows admins to pause contract activity on incident.
- **Server-side IPFS proxy** keeps Pinata keys off the client.

### Vulnerability Disclosure

ScoutOff follows responsible disclosure practices. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through our [Security Advisory](https://github.com/scout-off/scout-off-frontend/security/advisories/new) page or check our [security policy](SECURITY.md) and [security.txt](public/.well-known/security.txt) for more information.

## Getting started

> For full local development with contracts and backend, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

### 1. Install dependencies

If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use` in the project root first to switch to the pinned Node version (see `.nvmrc`). If you don't have that version installed, run `nvm install` instead. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full setup details.

```bash
nvm use        # or: nvm install
npm install
```

### 2. Build smart contracts

```bash
cd ../scout-off-contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
stellar contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/scout_off.wasm
```

### 3. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/scout_off.optimized.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

### 4. Initialize the contract

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --platform_token <TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --fee_config <FEE_CONFIG>
```

### 5. Run the frontend

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in contract and API values
npm run dev
```

## Testing & validation

```bash
npm run test
node scripts/validate-env.js
cd ../scout-off-contracts && cargo test
```

### Recommended validation

- ✅ Frontend tests pass
- ✅ Environment validation passes
- ✅ Contract integration tests pass for on-chain changes
- ✅ No secrets or credentials are committed
- ✅ Documentation is updated for new or changed behavior

## Configuration

### Quick setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Key environment variables

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK`      | `testnet` or `mainnet`                             |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL`  | Stellar Horizon endpoint                           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC`  | Soroban RPC endpoint                               |
| `PINATA_API_KEY`           | Pinata API key for IPFS uploads (server-side only) |
| `PINATA_SECRET`            | Pinata secret (server-side only)                   |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY` | IPFS gateway for serving media                     |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`      | Backend API base URL (default: localhost:4000)     |
| `PLATFORM_CONTACT_FEE_XLM` | XLM fee for pay-to-contact (default: 1)            |

## Testing

```bash
# Frontend tests
npm run test

# Frontend tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Frontend tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
npm run type-check    # Standalone CI job, excludes test files

# Validate env vars
node scripts/validate-env.js

# Smart contract tests (in scout-off-contracts repo)
cd ../scout-off-contracts && cargo test
```

Test coverage targets:

- ✅ Player registration and profile storage
- ✅ Milestone approval and progress level advancement
- ✅ Scout subscription and pay-to-contact fee handling
- ✅ Trial offer logging and Level 3 transition
- ✅ Validator authorization enforcement
- ✅ Fee accumulation and admin withdrawal
- ✅ Pause / unpause circuit breaker
- ✅ Edge cases: unauthorized validators, duplicate milestones, invalid fees

/**
 * milestoneEndorsementStore — off-chain academy-quorum attestations for
 * already-on-chain-approved milestones (issue #1185).
 *
 * On-chain, `approve_milestone` records exactly one validator address per
 * milestone — there is no contract concept of "N validators signed off."
 * This design deliberately does not try to make additional academy members
 * call `approve_milestone` again for the same milestone: repeating that
 * call would be a genuinely new on-chain action (it advances the player's
 * `progressLevel` a further step, or fails once already at the max level),
 * which is exactly the kind of on-chain side effect this issue says a
 * quorum configuration must never cause. Instead, each academy member who
 * agrees a milestone is legitimate records a lightweight off-chain
 * endorsement here — including the original approving validator, whose own
 * approval is recorded as their first endorsement right after their
 * transaction confirms (see components/validator/ApproveForm.tsx). Quorum
 * is then "how many distinct academy-member wallets have endorsed," read
 * entirely from this table.
 *
 * DB bootstrap and schema follow lib/adminAuditStore.ts's conventions:
 * shared bootstrap via lib/sqliteDb.ts's openSqliteDb, schema applied
 * through lib/sqliteMigrations.ts's versioned migration runner (see
 * lib/migrations/milestoneEndorsementMigrations.ts), process-wide
 * singleton.

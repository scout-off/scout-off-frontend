/**
 * IndexedDB-backed store for a pending player-onboarding submission that
 * needs to reach the Soroban network once connectivity returns (issue
 * #1181 — background sync for the onboarding wizard).
 *
 * This is deliberately separate from lib/offlineQueue.ts. That module's own
 * docstring scopes it to "non-financial, idempotent-safe" actions and
 * explicitly excludes signed blockchain transactions — a player
 * registration *is* a signed blockchain transaction, so it gets its own
 * store here, keyed by its own background-sync tag (`onboarding-sync`,
 * registered by hooks/useOnboardingSync.ts) rather than being shoehorned
 * into the generic queue.
 *
 * Read and written from two different JS execution contexts that cannot
 * otherwise share state:
 *  - the main thread, via hooks/useOnboardingSync.ts, and
 *  - the background-sync service worker, worker/index.js — which has no
 *    access to a live page's React state or to localStorage/sessionStorage,
 *    so IndexedDB is the only persistent storage both sides share.
 *
 * There is at most one queued submission per wallet — the wallet address is
 * the record's key, mirroring the "one profile per wallet" invariant the
 * contract itself enforces. A second offline submission attempt for a
 * wallet that already has one queued simply supersedes it.
